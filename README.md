# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
In this study, we aim to create a predictive model, which could be used to predict how many bike rentals will occur based on weather conditions throughout the year.  As a result, predictions can be made more quickly and efficiently.

Programming Language : Python

Libraries used : Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn

NoteBook : Google Colab

## Objective
We are provided with a Seoul Bike Dataset. The main objective is to build a predictive model on the given dataset, which could help to train a model to predict the number of bike rentals of the year given the weather conditions.

## Dataset 
This dataset contains bike usage patterns with the weather data to forecast bike rental demand. The data set consists of hourly rental data spanning two years.
It contains the following features: 

•	Date : year-month-day

•	Rented Bike count - Count of bikes rented at each hour

•	Hour - Hour of the day

•	Temperature-Temperature in Celsius

•	Humidity - %

•	Windspeed - m/s

•	Visibility - 10m

•	Dew point temperature - Celsius

•	Solar radiation - MJ/m2

•	Rainfall - mm

•	Snowfall - cm

•	Seasons - Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn

•	Holiday - Holiday/No holiday

•	Functional Day - NoFunc(Non Functional Hours), Fun(Functional hours)
